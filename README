NAME
    Chipmunk - 2D physics library

VERSION
    version 0.000001

SYNOPSIS
        use Chipmunk qw(:all);

DESCRIPTION
    Perl bindings for the Chipmunk Physics library.

METHODS
  enable_segment_to_segment_collisions
    Arguments: none
    Return value: not defined

    Chipmunk didn't support segment/segment collisions until v6.1.2. For
    compatibility reasons, you must explicitly and globally enable them.

        enable_segment_to_segment_collisions();

  reset_shape_id_counter
    Arguments: none
    Return value: not defined

    Chipmunk keeps a counter so that every new shape is given a unique hash
    value to be used in the spatial index. Because this affects the order in
    which the collisions are found and handled, you can reset the shape
    counter every time you populate a space with new shapes. If you don't,
    there might be (very) slight differences in the simulation.

        reset_shape_id_counter();
